ResSmith makes strong choices.

ResSmith separates decline modeling from economics. A forecast remains a forecast. Value remains an interpretation.

ResSmith keeps decline models explicit. Parameters are visible. Assumptions are inspectable. No model hides its form.

ResSmith treats preprocessing as part of the model pipeline. Smoothing, trimming, and resampling remain explicit steps.

ResSmith avoids black box optimization by default. Simple fitting methods stay available and readable. Advanced solvers remain optional.

ResSmith does not embed visualization. Plotsmith handles that role. This keeps ResSmith focused on estimation and value.

These decisions favor transparency over convenience. They support review, audit, and reuse across projects.
