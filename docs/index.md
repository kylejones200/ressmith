ResSmith builds value from production.

Decline curve analysis sits at the center of subsurface decision making. Rates become forecasts. Forecasts become reserves. Reserves become economics. ResSmith keeps that chain explicit.

ResSmith treats decline analysis as a workflow, not a formula. Data enters once. Models estimate behavior. Tasks define intent. Workflows return forecasts and value with clear provenance.

ResSmith fits practitioners who work with real well data. Rates arrive irregular. Phases overlap. Early time behavior breaks assumptions. ResSmith exposes these realities instead of smoothing them away.

ResSmith does not aim to replace specialized reservoir simulators. It provides a transparent, reproducible layer for decline modeling, forecasting, and economic evaluation that integrates cleanly with the rest of the smith ecosystem.
